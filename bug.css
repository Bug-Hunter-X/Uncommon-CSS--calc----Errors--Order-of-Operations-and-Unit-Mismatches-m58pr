The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes the order of operations or the use of units can cause unexpected results. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` in a situation where the parent container doesn't have a defined width can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect layout.

Another issue can arise from using `calc()` with different units. For example, mixing percentages and pixels might not give the intended result if the parent element's dimensions are not what was expected.
