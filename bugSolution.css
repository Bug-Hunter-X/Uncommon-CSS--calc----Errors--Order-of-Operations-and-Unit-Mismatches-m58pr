To avoid issues with CSS `calc()`, ensure you:

1. **Follow Order of Operations:**  Use parentheses to control the order of operations, explicitly separating parts of the calculation.
2. **Match Units Consistently:** Ensure that units are consistent within the calculation (pixels with pixels, percentages with percentages).  Avoid mixing different units unless you're certain of the parent container's dimensions.
3. **Verify Parent Dimensions:** If the calculation depends on the parent container's size, make sure the parent has properly defined dimensions (using `width`, `height`, or other relevant properties). Consider using `min-width` and `max-width` to manage responsiveness where needed.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy code:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
.container {
  width: 500px;
  /* Explicitly define the parent's width */
}

.element {
  width: calc((100% - 20px) / 2);
  /* Use parentheses to ensure correct order */
  box-sizing: border-box; 
}
```
